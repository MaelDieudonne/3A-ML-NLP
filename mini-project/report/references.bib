	abstract = {A major limitation in the automatic detection of affect, feelings, emotions, sentiments, and opinions in text is the lack of proper differentiation between these subjective terms and understanding of how they relate to one another. This lack of differentiation not only leads to inconsistency in terminology usage but also makes the subtleties and nuances expressed by the five terms difficult to understand, resulting in subpar detection of the terms in text. In light of such limitation, this paper clarifies the differences between these five subjective terms and reveals significant concepts to the computational linguistics community for their effective detection and processing in text.},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis labels a body of text as expressing either a positive or negative opinion, as in summarizing the content of an online product review. In this sense, sentiment analysis can be considered the challenge of building a classifier from text. Sentiment analysis can be done by counting the words from a dictionary of emotional terms, by fitting traditional classifiers such as logistic regression to word counts, or, most recently, by employing sophisticated neural networks. These methods progressively improve classification at the cost of increased computation and reduced transparency. A common sentiment analysis task, the classification of {IMDb} (Internet Movie Database) movie reviews, is used to illustrate the methods on a common task that appears frequently in the literature.},

These electronic Word of Mouth ({eWOM}) statements expressed on the web are much prevalent in business and service industry to enable customer to share his/her point of view. In the last one and half decades, research communities, academia, public and service industries are working rigorously on sentiment analysis, also known as, opinion mining, to extract and analyze public mood and views. In this regard, this paper presents a rigorous survey on sentiment analysis, which portrays views presented by over one hundred articles published in the last decade regarding necessary tasks, approaches, and applications of sentiment analysis. Several sub-tasks need to be performed for sentiment analysis which in turn can be accomplished using various approaches and techniques. This survey covering published literature during 2002–2015, is organized on the basis of sub-tasks to be performed, machine learning and natural language processing techniques used and applications of sentiment analysis. The paper also presents open issues and along with a summary table of a hundred and sixty-one articles.},

It is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text over different social media platforms. Social media plays an essential role in knowing the customer mindset towards a product, services, and the latest market trends. Most organizations depend on the customer's response and feedback to upgrade their offered products and services. {SA} or opinion mining seems to be a promising research area for various domains. It plays a vital role in analyzing big data generated daily in structured and unstructured formats over the internet. This survey paper defines sentiment and its recent research and development in different domains, including voice, images, videos, and text.

Countless marketing applications mine opinions from social media communication, news articles, customer feedback, or corporate communication. Various sentiment analysis methods are available and new ones have recently been proposed. Lexicons can relate individual words and expressions to sentiment scores. In contrast, machine learning methods are more complex to interpret, but promise higher accuracy, i.e., fewer false classifications. We propose an empirical framework and quantify these trade-offs for different types of research questions, data characteristics, and analytical resources to enable informed method decisions contingent on the application context. Based on a meta-analysis of 272 datasets and 12 million sentiment-labeled text documents, we find that the recently proposed transfer learning models indeed perform best, but can perform worse than popular leaderboard benchmarks suggest. We quantify the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, showing that, compared to widely established lexicons, transfer learning models on average classify more than 20 percentage points more documents correctly. To form realistic performance expectations, additional context variables, most importantly the desired number of sentiment classes and the text length, should be taken into account. We provide a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (called {SiEBERT}) with open-source scripts that can be applied as easily as an off-the-shelf lexicon.},

Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a gold-standard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Interestingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that {VADER} outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks.},

	abstract = {Natural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment, and document classiﬁcation. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these speciﬁc tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative ﬁne-tuning on each speciﬁc task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during ﬁne-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures speciﬁcally crafted for each task, signiﬁcantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9\% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7\% on question answering ({RACE}), and 1.5\% on textual entailment ({MultiNLI}).},

We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called {WebText}. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the {CoQA} dataset - matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, {GPT}-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underﬁts {WebText}. Samples from the model reﬂect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text. These ﬁndings suggest a promising path towards building language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis via artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning and large language models ({LLMs}), is a pivotal tool that classifies sentiments within texts as positive, negative, or neutral. It enables computers to automatically detect and interpret emotions from textual data, covering a spectrum of feelings without direct human intervention. Sentiment analysis is integral to marketing research, helping to gauge consumer emotions and opinions across various sectors. Its applications span analyzing movie reviews, monitoring social media, evaluating product feedback, assessing employee sentiments, and identifying hate speech. This study explores the application of both traditional machine learning and pre-trained {LLMs} for automated sentiment analysis of customer product reviews. The motivation behind this work lies in the demand for more nuanced understanding of consumer sentiments that can drive data-informed business decisions. In this research, we applied machine learning-based classifiers, i.e., Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine, alongside the {GPT}-4 model to benchmark their effectiveness for sentiment analysis. Traditional models show better results and efficiency in processing short, concise text, with {SVM} in classifying sentiment of short length comments. However, {GPT}-4 showed better results with more detailed texts, capturing subtle sentiments with higher precision, recall, and F1 scores to uniquely identify mixed sentiments not found in the simpler models. Conclusively, this study shows that {LLMs} outperform traditional models in context-rich sentiment analysis by not only providing accurate sentiment classification but also insightful explanations. These results enable {LLMs} to provide a superior tool for customer-centric businesses, which helps actionable insights to be derived from any textual data.},

Furthermore, {XLNet} integrates ideas from Transformer-{XL}, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining.

Specifically, we evaluate it in three settings, including {\textbackslash}emph\{standard\} evaluation, {\textbackslash}emph\{polarity shift\} evaluation and {\textbackslash}emph\{open-domain\} evaluation. We conduct an evaluation on 7 representative sentiment analysis tasks covering 17 benchmark datasets and compare {ChatGPT} with fine-tuned {BERT} and corresponding state-of-the-art ({SOTA}) models on them. We also attempt several popular prompting techniques to elicit the ability further. Moreover, we conduct human evaluation and present some qualitative case studies to gain a deep comprehension of its sentiment analysis capabilities.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even becoming competitive with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train {GPT}-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting.  For all tasks, {GPT}-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model.  {GPT}-3 achieves strong performance on many {NLP} datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks. We also identify some datasets where {GPT}-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where {GPT}-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora.},
